# gramian-factorisation-methods
This repository contains algorithms to rotate vectors to the nonnegative orthant.
To run the code, one first needs to install Julia, which at the time of writing can be obtained from https://julialang.org/downloads/.
This code was tested with Julia v1.9.1. It is likely to work for higher versions of Julia, with minor modifications.
For the skew-symmetric iteration, the additional libraries JuMP (https://github.com/jump-dev/JuMP.jl) and Tulip (https://github.com/ds4dm/Tulip.jl) are required to run the code.
We have tested the code with JuMP v.1.11.1 and Tulip v0.9.5.
